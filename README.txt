# Ethereum Identity Contract

This Solidity smart contract provides functionality for managing user identities and controlling access to both basic and personal information on the Ethereum blockchain.

## Description

The `Identity` contract allows users to register their basic and personal information securely. It implements a role-based access system to ensure that only authorized users can access specific information.

## Addressed Challenges

### 1. Authentication and Authorization

The contract ensures that users are authenticated and authorized before accessing information. It distinguishes between basic and personal users, granting access based on predefined roles.

### 2. Data Privacy

To address the challenge of data privacy on the blockchain, the contract restricts access to information based on user roles. Basic users can only access basic information, while personal users have access to both basic and personal information.

## Possible Solutions

- **External Encryption/Decryption**: Data can be encrypted off-chain before storage and decrypted only by authorized users.
  
- **Hash Comparison**: Hashes can be compared to verify data integrity without revealing its content.
  
- **Off-Chain Services**: Services like ChainLink can be used for secure interaction with external data sources.

## Usage

1. **Deployment**: Deploy the contract on the Ethereum network.

2. **User Registration**: The owner can register new users, specifying their type (basic or personal).

3. **Accessing Information**: Authenticated users can access information based on their permissions.
